# Python Import Standards

## Import Organization
- Always place imports at the top of files
- Use standard imports without try/except blocks per user preference
- Assume packages are installed and don't wrap imports in try/except
- Follow PEP 8 import ordering: standard library, third-party, local imports

## Import Patterns
- Use absolute imports when possible
- Import from `src` modules using the backend directory as the working directory
- The `backend/` directory is added to PYTHONPATH in scripts to enable `src` imports

## Example Import Structure
```python
# Standard library imports
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Third-party imports
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Local imports
from src.utils.logger import get_logger
from src.services.database_manager import DatabaseManager
```

## Error Prevention
- Avoid relative imports when possible
- Ensure all imports are available in the Poetry environment
- Use `poetry run` to execute scripts with proper environment
