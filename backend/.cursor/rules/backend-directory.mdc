# Backend Directory Requirements

## Critical Directory Rule
- **ALWAYS** run commands from the `backend/` directory, not from the project root
- Before executing any Python command, script, or program, verify we're in the correct directory
- Use `cd backend/` or ensure the working directory is `/path/to/expense-tracker/backend/`

## Why This Matters
This is critical because:
- `pyproject.toml` is located in `backend/`
- Poetry commands must be run from where `pyproject.toml` exists
- All Python imports assume the backend directory as the working directory
- Scripts in `backend/scripts/` expect to be run from `backend/`

## Directory Verification
Before running any command, check:
```bash
# Verify we're in the right place
pwd  # Should show: /path/to/expense-tracker/backend
ls pyproject.toml  # Should exist
```

## Error Prevention
If you see errors like:
- "Poetry could not find a pyproject.toml file"
- "No module named 'src'"
- Import errors in scripts

**First check**: Are we in the `backend/` directory?
