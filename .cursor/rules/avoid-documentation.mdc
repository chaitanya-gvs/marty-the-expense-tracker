# Documentation Generation Policy

## Rule
**DO NOT create markdown documentation files** (`.md` files) for every change or feature implementation unless explicitly requested by the user.

## When NOT to Create Documentation
- For routine code changes, bug fixes, or feature implementations
- For refactoring or optimization work
- For adding new endpoints, components, or services
- For configuration changes

## When Documentation IS Appropriate
Only create documentation when:
- The user explicitly asks for documentation to be written
- The user requests a README, guide, or summary document
- Creating setup instructions that are specifically requested

## Focus Instead On
- Writing clear, self-documenting code
- Adding inline comments where necessary
- Updating existing documentation if it becomes outdated
- Implementing the requested features and changes directly
