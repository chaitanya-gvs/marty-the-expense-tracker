# Development Server Management

## Hot Reload Configuration
Both the backend and frontend development servers run with automatic reload/hot module replacement (HMR):
- **Backend**: FastAPI with `uvicorn --reload` (automatically reloads on Python file changes)
- **Frontend**: Next.js with `npm run dev` (automatically reloads on file changes)

## Important Rules
- **DO NOT restart the development servers** after making code changes unless explicitly requested by the user
- The servers will automatically detect changes and reload
- Only restart servers when:
  - The user explicitly asks to restart them
  - Configuration files are changed (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, environment variables)
  - There are server-level issues that require a restart

## Common Commands (Use Only When Explicitly Requested)
Backend (from `backend/` directory):
```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Frontend (from `frontend/` directory):
```bash
npm run dev
```
