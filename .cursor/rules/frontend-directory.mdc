# Frontend Directory Requirements

## Critical Directory Rule
- **ALWAYS** run commands from the `frontend/` directory, not from the project root
- Before executing any Node.js, npm, or Next.js command, verify we're in the correct directory
- Use `cd frontend/` or ensure the working directory is `/path/to/expense-tracker/frontend/`

## Why This Matters
This is critical because:
- `package.json` is located in `frontend/`
- npm/yarn commands must be run from where `package.json` exists
- Next.js configuration expects to be run from the frontend directory
- All frontend imports and build processes assume the frontend directory as the working directory

## Directory Verification
Before running any command, check:
```bash
# Verify we're in the right place
pwd  # Should show: /path/to/expense-tracker/frontend
ls package.json  # Should exist
ls next.config.ts  # Should exist
```

## Error Prevention
If you see errors like:
- "Could not find package.json"
- "Next.js build failed"
- Import resolution errors
- Build configuration not found

**First check**: Are we in the `frontend/` directory?

## Common Frontend Commands
Always run these from the `frontend/` directory:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npx next build` - Build Next.js application
